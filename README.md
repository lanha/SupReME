## About

This is the authors' implementation of [1].

The code is implemented in MATLAB:
-  apexSample.mat            - a sample of an APEX image simulated to the Sentinel-2 responses
                                available at (http://www.apex-esa.org/content/free-data-cubes)
-  ms_fusion_apex.m          - a demo script that executes SupReME
-  ./functions               - all necessary functions
-  LICENSE                   - GPL license of the code
-  README                    - this file


## Notes

The co-registration of the different resolution channels is treated as with
real Sentinel-2 images.
